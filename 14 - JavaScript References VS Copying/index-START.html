    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // team[2] = 'Renyolds';
    // console.log(players, team);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(players, team2);
    team2[2] = 'something';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, team3);
    team3[2] = 'something';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(players, team4);
    team4[2] = 'something';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players, team5);
    team5[2] = 'something';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const person1 = person;
    // person1.age = 100;
    // console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 40 });
    person2.name = 'something';
    console.log(person, person2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3 = { ...person };
    person3.age = 100;
    console.log(person, person3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'John Doe',
      age: 100,

    // obj1.name = "changed";
    // console.log(obj, obj1);
    // obj1.social.github = 'change github';
    // console.log(obj, obj1);

    const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
